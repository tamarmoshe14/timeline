      <p>This timeline is a tool for those of you who want to deepen their understanding of the sequence of events before, during or after the holocaust. In this timeline you will find events that are related to world war 2, the holocaust and many other topics that fall under these categories.</p>
      <h2 class="title">How to use the timeline?</h2>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>The events are displayed on a timeline by the order of their date.</li>
        <li>By clicking an event you'll be able to see a short description of the event. Some of the events will contain an image or a map as well.</li>
        <li>You can filter the events on the timeline to suit your needs.</li>
        <li>You can zoom in and out of the timeline to see more or less events at once.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="title">Can I also upload events?</h2>
      <p>Sure! Click the 'Add Event' button in the top bar and log in using the username and password you received from the owner. Once you're logged in, you can add as many events as you want.</p>
